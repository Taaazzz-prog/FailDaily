thinking Addressing user feedback I need to tackle the user's complaint regarding the button changes. They want only validated items to show a green frame saying "valid," while unapproved items should remain signalable. Previously, the user had asked for a report button change, but now they'd like a smaller button instead of a large one. I need to ensure that comments or fails show if an item is reported, and I should modify the frontend to reflect these conditional renderings based on moderation status. Updating moderation status I realize we haven't included moderation status in our API responses yet. We need to enhance the backend endpoints to add fields for 'approved' or 'hidden/under_review' by using a left join. While we've already integrated fail_moderation in some queries, we haven't included status in mapFailRow. I can adjust this to display moderationStatus as either fail.moderation_status or default to 'approved'. We also need to update the SQL query in getsPublicFails to select fm.status properly. Fixing API joins I've noticed that in backend-api/src/routes/fails.js, we initially changed the simple query without including the fm join. While we modified the textProtocol, the join wasn't added. We also need to ensure that the FailsController.getPublicFails used in the /public route includes this join. Since /api/fails/public serves the failsNew.js route, we need to make sure that moderation_status is selected properly in our SQL query by including fm.status. I need to patch this up! Updating fail card details I need to add moderationStatus to mapFailRow, which currently expects fail.display_name and avatar_url. We can check if moderation_status exists and include it as needed. The Fail model might also include moderationStatus, but it's not essential. For the fail card, if an item is validated, meaning fm.status === 'approved', we should display a green banner. But if it's under review or not approved, we'll show a small report button as intended, keeping the user's request in mind. Updating comment and fail moderation statuses For comments, I need to ensure that the moderation status is included in the API response. Previously, we set cm.status as moderation_status, but we filtered for only approved or null statuses. If a comment's moderation_status is 'approved', I'll show a green chip; otherwise, a small report button needs to appear in the UI. I must modify commentsController.getComments to return moderationStatus, ensuring comment mapping reflects this. Additionally, the fail model lacks moderationStatus, so I’ll extend that too and adjust the FailsController.getPublicFails to include the moderation status in responses.Addressing user feedback I need to tackle the user’s complaint about the interface. Currently, we replaced the "Signaler" button with a "Contenu validé" chip, but the user wants only approved items to show as validated. They want a green frame for approved items, while signalable items should still have the button available. We’d need to modify the frontend to render this conditionally. Also, we should make sure any fails or comments display if reported, which means we need to adjust our API responses accordingly. Enhancing backend endpoints I need to add backend endpoints that include moderation status fields like 'approved' or 'hidden/under_review' using a left join. We've already joined fail_moderation in certain queries, but the mapping doesn't include status yet. I can modify mapFailRow to include moderationStatus: fail.moderation_status || 'approved'. In the failsController.getPublicFails SQL query, I’ll ensure to select fm.status as moderation_status. I also need to remember that some paths didn’t include the fm join, so I should adjust those routes accordingly. Updating route queries I noticed that earlier updates to backend-api/src/routes/fails.js didn’t include the fm join in certain queries. We modified the text protocol, but forgot to add the join for the FailsController that’s used by the /public route in failsNew.js. In server.js, failsPublicRoutes is mounted before the older routes, so it’s essential that /api/fails/ public serves through failsNew.js, which does utilize the fm join. Now, I need to ensure moderation_status is selected in FailsController.getPublicFails and finalize those SQL changes. Incorporating moderation status I need to include moderationStatus in mapFailRow since it currently expects fail.display_name and avatar_url. I can check if the moderation_status property exists and then add it. The Fail model could include moderationStatus, although it might not be strictly necessary. The fail-card can show whether something is validated or display a report button. If fm.status is 'approved', we’ll show a green banner; otherwise, a smaller 'signaler' button should appear. If moderation_status is null, we’ll show the report button as well. Updating comment moderation status I need to ensure that we include the cm.status for comments in the GET request. Previously, we had it in the SELECT as moderation_status, but we filtered to show only approved comments or null. For visible comments, moderation_status may be null if they’ve never been reported or approved if cm.status is 'approved'. In the UI, I want to show a green chip for approved comments, and a small report button otherwise. I’ll modify the comments-thread component to include moderationStatus in the response by adding it to commentsController.getComments. Updating comment posting and display For the POST request of a new comment, I noticed we didn't include moderation status, which is fine as it would be null if not reported. In the comment.service.ts, the CommentItem interface currently doesn't have moderationStatus, so I’ll extend it to include optional values like 'approved', 'hidden', or 'under_review'. I need to ensure we map this in the list(...) and add(...) functions. Also, we removed the report button from the UI but will reintroduce a small button that appears conditionally for unapproved comments. In comments-thread.component.html, I plan to display a "Commentaire validé" chip for approved comments and a minimal 'Signaler' button for others. Extending fail card functionality The fail card needs to access the fail's moderationStatus, but currently, the fail model doesn't have this included. I’ll extend the Fail mapping in FailsController to incorporate this property. In the frontend, fail.model.ts also needs an optional moderationStatus?: string. It’s crucial to ensure that MysqlService.getPublicFails correctly retrieves items with moderation status info. It seems we rely on failsNew for the '/public' endpoint, which uses FailsController.getPublicFails and processes the results. I should map the moderationStatus in the processed data and ensure it is correctly utilized in fail.service.ts so the fail card only shows a chip for approved comments; otherwise, it will default to a report button. Updating validated chip display I need to ensure that the initial 'validated' chip only shows up when moderationStatus is 'approved'. To make this happen, I'll patch the backend by updating FailsController.getPublicFails to select fm.status as moderation_status. Once that’s done, we can ensure that the UI reflects this logic, so the chip only appears in the appropriate cases. That should help clarify which fails have been appropriately validated. Adjusting query properties It looks like I need to update the getFailById query to include fm.status and a property. In routes/fails.js, the public route was not adjusted, but the server uses failsNew, so that part is fine. I'll add the moderationStatus property to each comment in CommentsController.getComments, since we missed storing that in the flat object initially. I also want to ensure the Fail model includes is_anonyme and consider adding moderationStatus to the type. On the front end, I’ll need to adjust the UI to conditionally display a chip/report link. Adjusting UI elements and data flow I’m planning to re-add a small icon button or text—something compact—styled to minimize its size. For the comments thread, I’ll include a tiny report link for items with a non-approved moderation status. Chips will only display when moderationStatus is approved. I also need to ensure that components have access to moderation status. In the FailCardComponent, the data comes from FailService.getPublicFails, so I’ll add the moderationStatus property to the JSON output in failsController. This way, it flows through the system properly, and I’ll include that in the Fail model. Updating the fail model and backend I need to modify the fail.model.ts to include an optional moderationStatus property, allowing for values like 'approved', 'hidden', or 'under_review'. For the comments thread, the commentsThread.service will utilize commentsController.getComments, which returns an array of comments with the added moderationStatus. I'll update the CommentItem type in comment.service.ts to include this optional property too. On the backend, in failsController.js, I’ll adjust the SQL selection in getPublicFails to add fm.status AS moderation_status, and update the processed mapping accordingly. Additionally, I'll also include moderation_status in the getFailById selection.Adjusting UI for validation I think we need to tweak the UI logic since we replaced buttons with a validation chip. The requirement is that only approved content should be marked as "validé," and I realize we removed the report button for non-approved content. The user wants these to always be signalable, so we need to reinstate that button. Also, I should extend API responses to ensure they include the moderation status for fails/comments to meet our new requirements. Updating comment moderation responses I realize that the commentsController.getComments now selects the moderation status, but we haven’t sent that back in the response yet. I need to add a field, like moderationStatus, so the UI can use it. For fails, I can join fail_moderation and include its status in the responses. Similarly, we need to ensure that if a comment's status is 'approved', the chip displays, while a report button shows for other statuses. It's crucial that visible content still has the "Signaler" button. Updating fail routes for moderation I need to reintroduce a small text link or button. To implement these changes in the backend, I should update routes/ fails.js to add a LEFT JOIN with fail_moderation and include its status as moderation_status in the SELECT statement. I realize I've already modified getPublicFails in failsController, but routes/fails.js is utilized by front services. Earlier, we didn't adjust this file besides converting the text protocol, so it’s time to update the SELECT clause accordingly. Clarifying fail processing logic I need to clarify how failsController and routes/fails.js work together. The function mysql.service.getPublicFails hits ${apiUrl}/fails/public, which based on routes/fails.js, returns a success response without applying any moderation filter or including the status. In my earlier adjustments, I ensured that failsController.getPublicFails now works with the /api/fails/public path, but the route needs to return the moderation status. I realize this is about ensuring that processed rows include the status for accurate client responses. Extending moderation status mapping I think we can enhance the processed mapping by adding the moderationStatus property from row.fm.status. Our current query selects f.*, p..., and while we changed getPublicFails SQL, we need to ensure that fm.status is included too. I'll modify it to select fm.status AS moderation_status. For getFailById, I can do the same. In routes/fails.js, we're okay since the server uses failsNew. Also, I need to ensure moderationStatus is added to comment data, and the fail model will include this optional property. Adjusting component display for moderation We need to revise our components to conditionally display the chip or report link. After removing the report button, I’ll add back a small link or button in the fail-card HTML that triggers onReportFail if the moderationStatus isn’t 'approved'. Since onReportFail still exists in the component, it will call the reportFail service. I plan to style this link to keep it small. For the comments thread, I'll also include a tiny report link for non-approved statuses. Lastly, I need to ensure components access the moderation status correctly—like checking where FailCardComponent gets its fail data. Updating fail and comment mappings I need to pass the moderationStatus through our mappings starting from the FailService.getPublicFails, which fetches a response. In failsController.getPublicFails, I'll add the moderationStatus property to the JSON output. The mysql.service.getPublicFails will then relay this to FailService.loadFails, allowing for the inclusion of failData.moderationStatus in the fail model. I'll also update fail.model.ts to include moderationStatus as an optional property. For the comments, I'll add moderationStatus to the CommentItem type in comment.service.ts. Finally, in backend-api/src/ controllers/failsController.js, I need to adjust the SQL selection to include fm.status AS moderation_status and set mapped.moderationStatus accordingly in the processed mapping. Implementing moderation status in mapping I need to derive row.moderation_status and update the processed mapping accordingly. For the getFailById selection in backend-api/src/controllers/failsController.js, I’ll add fm.status AS moderation_status. When returning the object for the getFailByIdEndpoint, I should just include this property in the mapped fail. Earlier, the failController.js already returns a mapping, so I'll also ensure that moderationStatus is added in the mapping there as well. This will help streamline our data flow. Adjusting UI behavior I need to fix the current UI display where the "Contenu validé" chip shows for all visible fails/comments. The user wants that only the approved one should be shown as validated, while others need to show a report button instead. It's crucial that chips appear only when content is approved; otherwise, I should display a smaller report button. We also need to adjust the API responses to include moderation status for fails and comments, allowing conditional rendering on the frontend. Updating fail and comment status I need to update how failsController.getPublicFails and getComments handle moderation status. Currently, the mapping function for fails doesn't include status, although we joined fail_moderation in some queries. For comments, we joined comment_moderation but removed moderation_status from the mapping. I should add moderationStatus to comment data and ensure the public endpoint for fails uses a simpler query, including fm.status. I’ll modify the relevant queries to include this status in the mapping, ensuring proper data handling. Updating fail query and status I need to ensure that we update the getFails function to join fm and select fm.status as moderation_status in the query. In the earlier patch, I added the join but I'm not sure if I specified the status correctly. Also, in getFailById, I need to add fm.status as moderation_status. Although it's not necessary for the end-user list, the card does need the status for conditional display. I'll update the fail model and adjust fail.service.ts to read moderation status, displaying the validation chip only when it's approved. Reintroducing report button and moderation status I need to revert the earlier removal of the report button by adding a small 'Signaler' button with a tiny size and reduced CSS. When clicked, it should call failService.reportFail. the smaller 'Signaler' as an icon button or tiny link. I also need to adjust the CommentItem interface to add moderationStatus. In the comments API, I should include moderationStatus: comment.moderation_status || null to ensure the response mapping includes the necessary status. Updating comment components and backend In the comments thread template, I’ll ensure the chip displays only when c.moderationStatus==='approved'; otherwise, it should show a small 'Signaler' button that calls onReport(c). I need to update comments-thread.component.html to conditionally render the button and adjust fail-card.component.html to include a smaller report button for non-approved cases. For the backend changes, I’ll modify the route in fails.js to include LEFT JOIN fail_moderation and filter by fm.status AS moderation_status. I also need to ensure that fm.status is included in the getPublicFails and other related controllers to maintain data integrity across the application. Let's implement these patches!
